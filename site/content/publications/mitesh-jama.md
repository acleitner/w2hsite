  Activity Data

summary: >-
  Despite the potential of pedometers to increase physical activity and improve
  health, there is little evidence of broad adoption by the general population.
  In contrast, nearly two-thirds of adults in the United States own a smartphone
  and technology advancements have enabled these devices to track health
  behaviors such as physical activity and provide convenient feedback. New
  wearable devices that may have more consumer appeal have also been developed.


  Even though these devices and applications might better engage individuals in
  their health, for example through workplace wellness programs, there has been
  little evaluation of their use. The objective of this study was to evaluate
  the accuracy of smartphone applications and wearable devices compared with
  direct observation of step counts, a metric successfully used in interventions
  to improve clinical outcomes.
