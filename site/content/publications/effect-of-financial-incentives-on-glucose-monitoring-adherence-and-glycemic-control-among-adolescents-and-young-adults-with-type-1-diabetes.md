  Control Among Adolescents and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes

summary: >-
  In a randomized clinical trial including 90 adolescents and young adults with
  poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, daily financial incentives improved glucose
  monitoring in the intervention group (50.0%) vs the control group (18.9%) but
  did not affect their glycemic control. Financial incentives showed promise for
  improving glucose monitoring behaviors among adolescents and young adults with
  type 1 diabetes
