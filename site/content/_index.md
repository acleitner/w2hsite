subtitle: Research new and apply scientifically proven personalized engagement strategies in your patient population
summary: Way to Health is a web-based platform that enables and automates research into healthy behavior interventions. Interventions found to be successful can be applied to various populations and rolled out at scale quickly.

patientcommunication:
  title: Communication with patients and / or study participants is key to engaging them in their health. You can choose from a variety of communication techniques or combine them in interesting ways tailored to a patient's behavior.

      header: Two way Texting
      text: >
        Texting (SMS) has been shown repeatedly to be a very effective way of communicating with patients since it works irrespective of the kind of phone the patient has. Texts can be sent out based on set schedules and / or rules. These configuration rules can be as simple as responding with a personalized "Great job, John Appleseed" or as complex as evaluating blood pressure values and responding with an provider or nurse alert.

      header: Integrated Survey Management
      text: >
        In cases where more data needs to be collected where a form or a survey makes more sense - demographics, symptoms etc., the system offers that ability too. You can either integrate with Qualtrics or create your own surveys from scratch using the built-in survey creation and deployment tool. These surveys can be sent out to patients based on specific schedules and simple or complex rules.

        In other cases, patients might not have smart phones or at the other extreme, might prefer a native app. We have you covered in both cases. Patients can access their data through any modern browser on desktops as well as mobile devices. Alternately, they can install an iOS or Android native app. In this latter case, study or program specific download and installation links can be automatically sent out on enrollment. 

deviceintegration:
  title: Healthcare data is overwhelming and complex. We provide direct integrations into a range of devices including Electronic Health Records (EHRs) so your team can focus on innovation, efficiency, and outcomes. We capture remotely collected health data simply and seamlessly into our system, enabling scalable, integrated and personalized initiatives.

      header: Vitals Monitoring
      text: >
        The platform integrates directly with a number of biomedical devices to capture vitals directly from the patient / participant. The kinds of vitals captured include blood pressure, medication adherence, sleep tracking, weight, blood glucose and many more continue to be added. Additional devices are added quickly on request.

        Similar to vitals, the platform also integrates with a number of consumer physical activity devices such as Fitbit, Nokia (Withings), Moves, Misfit. Data captured includes daily, minute level and intensity data.

      header: EHR Integrations
      text: > 
        It is our belief that EHRs should be the system of record for all patient data. Additionally, any provider action needed should also be done via the EHR. With this in mind, the platform provides bi-directional integration currently with Epic (and additional EHRs on request).

rct:
  title: There are plenty of clinical trials management software (CTMS) solutions out there. However, they are either built for pharmaceutical / drug discovery (Velos, Oncore etc.) or are very general purpose (e.g. Redcap). Way To Health is a tool purpose built to design and deploy behavioral change and interventional (bedside to home) research .

      text: >
        Way to Health has demonstrated its value as a research platform in this domain by supporting over 80 trials and $45 million in funding.  The platform, past and current Principal Investigators (PIs) and its uses have credibility among the research and funding communities.

        Setup multiple arms for studies, including of course, the control arm. The platform also offers multiple computerized randomization of participants, including the configurable choices for stratified, blocked, weighted, and adaptive randomization strategies

      text: > 
        Online and mobile participant enrollment and associated survey administration is available out of the box. Additionally, ongoing patient / participant management is offered through a "triage" view that allows for rapid exception based management, contextual information and data capture.

  title: We believe technology assisted motivation & human behavior change is the key to advancing health outcomes. Behavioral economics is one of the most promising methods to change behavior. Various social and financial incentives are pre-built and available in the platform.

      text: >
        Different strokes for different folks.A gain-frame is when you frame a choice focused on the positive outcome.  A loss-frame is when you focus on the costs or the loss, such as opportunity cost. Both are available in the platform.

      header: Lotteries
      text: >
        "So you're saying I have a chance?" Lottery based incentives can be easily applied to activities - steps, weighings, pretty much any data gathered by the platform from any data source. Lotteries have been shown to be successful when continuous "check-ins" are required.

      header: Gamification & Social
      text: > 
        Given recent trends, it is safe to assume that games and social media are significant drivers of human behavior. The platform allows patients to earn points, level up, use lifelines and more. Now combine this with peers or support partners and the results can be eye-opening. 

rulesengine:
  title: In the research context, interventions are invariably unique. In the clinical context, interventions need to be targeted and personalized to be effective. The Way To Health platform provides a flexible rules engine with easy configuration driven by data captured from patients via communications or devices.

      header: Event based
      text: >
        Think of events as data driven triggers. Based on the trigger specific tasks can be kicked off. An simple example would be to send a congratulatory SMS when the patient hits their medication adherence or activity goal. Researchers have used the engine to create much more complex rules driven by raw and calculated data.

      header: Schedule driven
      text: >
        Repetition is the key to success. All interventions tend to require recurrence based on a defined period - hours, days, weeks or months. Research studies or clinical deployments both require this to be further tailored by each arm or participant. The platform has been designed to support these use cases and more.

      text: > 
        Pay attention to only exceptions and only when you are alerted about them. The Way To Health platform allows for the creation of incidents whenever certain criteria are met and additionally also allows for the configuration of notifications depending on the user's role - patient, participant, admin, provider, research coordinator...
