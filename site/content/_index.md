      text: >
        Texting (SMS) has been shown repeatedly to be a very effective way of communicating with patients since it works irrespective of the kind of phone the patient has. Texts can be sent out based on set schedules and / or rules. These configuration rules can be as simple as responding with a personalized "Great job, John Appleseed" or as complex as evaluating blood pressure values and responding with an provider or nurse alert.

      text: >
        In cases where more data needs to be collected where a form or a survey makes more sense - demographics, symptoms etc., the system offers that ability too. You can either integrate with Qualtrics or create your own surveys from scratch using the built-in survey creation and deployment tool. These surveys can be sent out to patients based on specific schedules and simple or complex rules.

        In other cases, patients might not have smart phones or at the other extreme, might prefer a native app. We have you covered in both cases. Patients can access their data through any modern browser on desktops as well as mobile devices. Alternately, they can install an iOS or Android native app. In this latter case, study or program specific download and installation links can be automatically sent out on enrollment.

rct:
  title: There are plenty of clinical trials management software (CTMS) solutions out there. However, they are either built for pharmaceutical / drug discovery (Velos, Oncore etc.) or are very general purpose (e.g. Redcap). Way To Health is a tool purpose built to design and deploy behavioral change and interventional (bedside to home) research .
